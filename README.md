# ChatOps WG 2018/01 - Data

<!--
  TODO: chatops-wg (the working group) have a defined date limit, but this
        repository will probably continue to be used as a starting point for
        open source tools related to data manipulation by non-specialists.
        We should have special attention to tools who could be managed even
        on very poor internet conditions (fititnt, 2018-03-25 17:56 BRT)

Research on Data Lake philosophy & simplified interfaces as one way to make
easier less specialized coworkers to bootstrap intelligent agents. Read
[chatops-wg#32](https://github.com/fititnt/chatops-wg/issues/32) initial
motivation.

**Philosophically speaking: we have a _Humans + Intelligent Interface + machines_
working as team, where who do DevOps [optimize for the full team](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zhkTHkIZJEc&feature=youtu.be&t=18m45s).**
This approach is similar to [NoOps](https://cloud.google.com/why-google/no-ops/),
but we try abstract even more to a point where is need coworkers with less
required knowledge on the underline technology but higher focus on the human
side. (e.g. instead of develop considering support a full team of 10+ software
developers in todays NoOps, do the infrastructure for a team of 1 or 2
voluntaries with IT background supporting pro-bono people from different
skills, like social scientists, psychologists, social work assistant, etc).
